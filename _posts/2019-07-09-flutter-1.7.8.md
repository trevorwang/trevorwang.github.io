Flutter 1.7.8 最新稳定版发布了, 最主要修复了在[同一 APK 同时支持 32 位和 64 位的bug](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/18494)， 这样就不用 使用这种黑科技来打包支持国内市场了，真香！！

修复的其他一些 bug 列表（部分）

### v1.7.6

- [#34684](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/34684) The return type of the almost never used `ParentDataWidget.debugDescribeInvalidAncestorChain` method is now `Iterable<DiagnosticsNode>` instead of `String`. Existing uses can call `.join('\n')` on the return value if they need to continue to use a `String` instead of a `DiagnosticsNode`.

### v1.7.4

- [#30069](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/30069) Text inline widgets allows embedding arbitrary widgets inline with text. `TextSpan`has also been reworked to inherit from `InlineSpan`, in order to support `WidgetSpan`, which is used to define inline widgets. Existing uses of `TextSpan` should not assume the object is of type `TextSpan` anymore.

### v1.7.1

- [#33480](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/33480) The `FadeInImage` widget no longer supports the `placeholderSemanticLabel`property.

### v1.6.7

- [#32374](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/32374) The `Image` widget now supports two new properties: `frameBuilder`, and `loadingBuilder`, which enable callers to easily add a placeholder image which the image ios loading, add effects to the image once it loads (such as fading it in), and monitor the loading progress of the image (e.g. to show the user a loading indicator).

### v1.6.3

- [#33148](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/33148) ExpandIcon now uses Colors.white60 instead of Colors.white54 when dark theme is used (ThemeData.brightness is set to Brightness.dark).

### v1.6.2

- [#32936](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/32936) cleaned up the `ImageStream` listener API. `addListener()` and `removeListener()`now take an instance of `ImageStreamListener`, which contains references to the individual callbacks. See [the announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/flutter-announce/NWTszrEq9U0) for more information.

### v1.6.1

- [#32528](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/32528) Tapping a modal bottom sheet no longer dismisses it by default.

### v1.6.0

- [#30983](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/30983) To support structured error messages [#27327](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/27327) the signature of InformationCollector and the context parameter of the FlutterErrorDetails constructor were changed. This should not impact you unless your package is attempting behave like part of the Flutter framework. See [this comment](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/31962#issuecomment-488882515) which discusses how to write code that is forwards and backwards compatible with this change.
- [framework #31569](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/31569)/[engine #8695](https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/8695) Rect and RRect are now const constructable and are backed by 64 bit doubles rather than 32 bit floats internally.
- [framework #31917](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/31917) <- [engine #8796](https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/8796) <- [dart 1dd0f88c84](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/1dd0f88c84) Fixes bug in StreamIterator which allowed constructor argument to be null. Also allowed await for on a null stream. This is now a runtime error.
- [#30884](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/30884) `TabController.animationController` changed to be `unbounded` to allow `DefaultTabController` to handle changes to number of tabs (after initial build).
